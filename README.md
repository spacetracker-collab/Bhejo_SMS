**Bhejo_SMS_Functionality**

BhejoSMS means actually "Send Short Messaging Service". It was developed at a time when texting was all the rage. There was a Django Portal on which a user would register his primary email id along with a list of his or her phone numbers. Any person could send him or her an exchange or gmail message with a calendar invite to take his or her medications. A script would connect to his mail box and read the messages and send him or her an SMS to take his or her medications at the given time. This use case could obviously pivot to booking meetings but it was primarily targeted at people who have to take regular medications.

**Bhejo_SMS_Code**

The application was developed  using UML modeling and Python. I have only the commit log which illustrates the structure of the application. We planned to sell this to top pharmaeutical companies.
